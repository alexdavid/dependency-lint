Feature: Executed module: npm

  As a developer with a script that executes npm that is locally installed
  I want it to be reported as unused because it is globally installed


  Scenario: dependency not listed
    Given I have no dependencies listed
    And the "npm" module exposes the executable "npm"
    And I have a script named "install" defined as "npm run build"
    When I run "dependency-lint"
    Then I see the output
      """
      ✓ 0 errors
      """


  Scenario: dependency listed
    Given I have "npm" installed and listed as a dependency
    And the "npm" module exposes the executable "npm"
    And I have a script named "install" defined as "npm run build"
    When I run "dependency-lint"
    Then I see the output
      """
      dependencies:
        ✖ npm (unused)

      ✖ 1 error
      """
    And it exits with a non-zero status


  Scenario: devDependency
    Given I have no devDependencies listed
    And the "npm" module exposes the executable "npm"
    And I have a script named "pretest" defined as "npm run lint"
    When I run "dependency-lint"
    Then I see the output
      """
      ✓ 0 errors
      """
